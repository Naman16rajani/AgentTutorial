NutrientID,Nutrient,Description,ImportancetoPlants
1,Nitrogen (N),"Essential for plant growth, promotes lush, green foliage.","Critical for leaf and stem development, helps plants grow rapidly and improves overall health."
2,Phosphorus (P),"Vital for energy transfer and photosynthesis, helps in root and flower development.","Supports strong root systems, improves flowering and fruit production."
3,Potassium (K),"Helps with water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigor.","Increases drought tolerance, improves fruit quality, and enhances overall resistance to disease."
4,Calcium (Ca),"Strengthens cell walls, improves soil structure and aids in nutrient uptake.","Promotes strong cell walls and healthy plant structure, preventing diseases and growth disorders."
5,Magnesium (Mg),"Central to photosynthesis, as it is part of the chlorophyll molecule.","Supports healthy leaf color and photosynthesis, and helps with the formation of seeds and fruit."
6,Sulfur (S),"Key component of some amino acids and vitamins, supports overall plant metabolism.","Necessary for protein synthesis and enzyme function, promotes healthy growth and disease resistance."
7,Iron (Fe),Essential for the formation of chlorophyll and acts as a catalyst for several biochemical processes.,"Supports green leaves, plays a role in photosynthesis, and is crucial for healthy root and shoot growth."
8,Zinc (Zn),"Important for hormone production and enzyme function, especially in the production of chlorophyll.","Aids in enzyme function and overall growth, supports better seed production and root development."
9,Copper (Cu),"Required for photosynthesis, respiration, and lignin formation in plant cell walls.","Supports reproductive growth, helps with disease resistance, and ensures proper flower and fruit development."
10,Manganese (Mn),"Involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen metabolism.","Helps with chlorophyll production and nitrogen assimilation, promotes healthy leaves and root growth."
11,Boron (B),"Essential for cell wall formation and reproductive growth, affects sugar transport and metabolism.","Promotes healthy cell wall structure, flowering, fruit set, and seed development."
12,Molybdenum (Mo),"Necessary for nitrogen fixation and utilization, and the formation of enzymes involved in plant metabolism.","Helps plants use nitrogen effectively, crucial for legumes and nitrogen-fixing plants."
